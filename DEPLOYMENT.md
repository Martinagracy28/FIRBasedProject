# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues with Current Setup

This app is currently configured for **Replit** environment and has several challenges for Vercel deployment:

### 1. **Database Connection**
- App uses Neon PostgreSQL with Replit environment variables
- Need to set up database connection in Vercel environment

### 2. **Full-Stack Architecture**
- App has both frontend (React) and backend (Express) in single repo
- Vercel works better with separated frontend/backend or serverless functions

### 3. **Environment Variables**
- DATABASE_URL and other secrets need to be configured in Vercel

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Replit Deploy (Recommended)
Since this app is already working perfectly on Replit:

1. **Stay on Replit**: Use Replit's built-in deployment
2. **Click "Deploy" button** in Replit interface
3. **Configure custom domain** if needed
4. **All environment variables already set up**

### Option 2: Deploy Frontend Only to Vercel
1. **Deploy only the React frontend** to Vercel
2. **Keep backend on Replit** 
3. **Update API URLs** to point to Replit backend
4. **Configure CORS** for cross-origin requests

### Option 3: Full Migration to Vercel
1. **Split into separate repos**: frontend and backend
2. **Deploy frontend** to Vercel
3. **Deploy backend** as Vercel serverless functions
4. **Migrate database** to Vercel-compatible service
5. **Reconfigure environment variables**

## Quick Replit Deploy

For fastest deployment with minimal changes:

1. Go to your Replit project
2. Click the **"Deploy"** button in the top-right
3. Choose **"Autoscale Deployment"**
4. Your app will be live at a `.replit.app` domain

This keeps all your database connections and environment variables working perfectly.

## Current App Status

✅ **Working on Replit**: Database connected, users registering
✅ **Environment**: All secrets and variables configured  
✅ **Features**: Registration, verification, FIR filing all functional

The app is production-ready on Replit. Vercel deployment would require significant restructuring.
